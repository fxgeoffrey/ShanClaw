# ShanClaw (`shan`)

AI agent runtime powered by Shannon. Daemon mode connects to Shannon Cloud via WebSocket for channel messaging (Slack, LINE, Feishu, Telegram, webhook), with local tool execution and streaming results. Also provides interactive TUI, one-shot CLI, and MCP server. Named agents with independent instructions/memory, local tools for macOS computer control, MCP client for third-party integrations (GitHub, databases, etc.), local scheduled tasks via launchd, and remote research/swarm orchestration via the Shannon Gateway API.

## Installation

### Option A: npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @kocoro/shanclaw
```

Auto-updates on every launch — no manual upgrading needed.

### Option B: Install Script

Downloads the latest release binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kocoro-lab/ShanClaw/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Option C: Build from Source

Requires **Go 1.25+**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kocoro-lab/ShanClaw.git
cd ShanClaw
go install .
```

> **Note:** `go install` places the binary in `$GOPATH/bin` (default: `~/go/bin`).
> Make sure this directory is in your PATH:
> ```bash
> # Add to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc if not already present:
> export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
> ```
> Then restart your shell or run `source ~/.zshrc`.

### Verify Installation

```bash
shan --help
```

## Updating

shan auto-updates when you launch it. You can also update explicitly:

```bash
shan update              # manual update
npm update -g @kocoro/shanclaw  # if installed via npm (re-runs postinstall to fetch latest)
```

## Setup

ShanClaw requires a Gateway API for LLM completions and remote tools.

**Option A: Shannon Cloud** — get an API key from [shannon.run](https://shannon.run):

```bash
shan --setup
# Enter endpoint: https://api-dev.shannon.run
# Enter API key: <your key from shannon.run>
```

**Option B: Self-hosted** — run the open-source [Shannon Gateway](https://github.com/Kocoro-lab/Shannon) locally:

```bash
# Clone and run Shannon Gateway (see repo for full instructions)
git clone https://github.com/Kocoro-lab/Shannon.git
cd Shannon && docker compose up -d

# Point shan to your local instance
shan --setup
# Enter endpoint: http://localhost:8080
# Enter API key: (leave empty for local)
```

**Option C: Ollama (local LLMs)** — run models locally with [Ollama](https://ollama.com):

```bash
# Install and start Ollama, then pull a model
ollama pull llama3.1

# Configure shan to use Ollama
# In ~/.shannon/config.yaml:
provider: ollama
ollama:
  endpoint: "http://localhost:11434"   # default, can be omitted
  model: "llama3.1"
```

When `provider: ollama` is set, ShanClaw connects to Ollama's OpenAI-compatible API. Standard function tools work; native Anthropic tool types (computer use) are not available. Thinking models (e.g. Qwen3) are supported — reasoning output is surfaced with a `[thinking]` prefix.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive mode — chat with Shannon in your terminal
shan

# One-shot mode — ask a question and get an answer
shan "who is wayland zhang"

# Use a named agent
shan --agent ops-bot "check production health"

# Configure your endpoint and API key
shan --setup
```

### Interactive Commands

In the TUI (`shan`), type `/` to access built-in commands:

```bash
/research deep "latest advances in AI agents"    # deep research via Gateway
/swarm "build a marketing plan for our launch"   # multi-agent orchestration
/model large                                      # switch to large model
/copy                                             # copy last response to clipboard
/sessions                                         # browse and resume past sessions
/session new                                      # start a fresh session
/search websocket reconnect                       # search session history

```bash
# In TUI — agent opens and controls Ghostty terminals
"open a new terminal and run top"
"open a new split to the right running go test ./... -v and tell me the results"
"set up my dev environment: open a new terminal running the server, and a new split tailing logs"

# CLI — open one Ghostty window per agent

shan "show all tables in the database"              # sqlite MCP
```

### Multi-step Cowork Recipes

Beyond one-shot prompts, the daemon is meant to carry multi-step work that spans research, browser automation, and artifact generation in a single session. A growing set of recipes lives in [`examples/cookbook/`](examples/cookbook/):

- **[Publish a Truth Social digest to note.com from Slack](examples/cookbook/slack-to-note-publish.md)** — `web_search` + `web_fetch` for research → Playwright MCP to publish in the user's authenticated browser.
- **[Scrape a Substack and generate a Word doc](examples/cookbook/substack-scrape-to-docx.md)** — attempted browser scraping, pivot to the site's JSON API, then `docx` skill → doc on the user's Desktop.

Each recipe is short and pattern-focused — key tools, gotchas, when to reach for it. Add one when you find a task shape you keep coming back to; [`examples/cookbook/README.md`](examples/cookbook/README.md) has the format.

## Requirements

- **macOS** (clipboard, notifications, AppleScript, screencapture, accessibility)
- **Shannon Gateway** at configurable endpoint (for LLM completions + remote tools)
- **Accessibility permission** granted in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility (for `accessibility` and `computer` tools)
- **Chrome** (optional, for browser automation — Playwright MCP preferred, chromedp fallback with isolated profile)
- **[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) >= 1.3.0** (optional, for `ghostty` tool — terminal tabs, splits, input)

## CLI Usage

```bash
shan                              # interactive TUI
shan "who is wayland zhang"       # one-shot mode (prompts for tool approval)
shan -y "query"                   # one-shot, auto-approve all tools
shan --agent ops-bot "query"      # use a named agent
shan --setup                      # configure endpoint + API key
shan mcp serve                    # start MCP server over stdio
shan daemon start                 # start channel messaging daemon

## Local Tools

Local tools executed on your macOS machine:

### File Operations

| Tool | Approval | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `file_read` | CWD auto | Read files with line numbers (offset/limit). Images (png/jpg/gif/webp) returned as base64 vision blocks. PDFs rendered page-by-page via Swift/PDFKit (offset=start page, limit=page count). |
| `file_write` | Yes | Write/create files, creates parent dirs |
| `file_edit` | Yes | Find-and-replace (old_string must be unique) |
| `glob` | CWD auto | Find files by pattern (supports `**` recursive) |
| `grep` | CWD auto | Search file contents (ripgrep, falls back to grep) |
| `directory_list` | CWD auto | List directory contents with sizes |

### System & Shell

| Tool | Approval | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `bash` | Auto for safe | Shell commands, 120s timeout, safe commands auto-approved |
| `system_info` | No | OS, arch, hostname, CPU, memory, disk |
| `process` | Auto for list/ports | Process management: list, ports, kill |
| `http` | Network allowlist | HTTP client, localhost auto-approved |
| `think` | No | Scratchpad for reasoning — not sent to tools, stays in context |

### macOS Control

| Tool | Approval | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `accessibility` | Yes | **Primary GUI tool.** Reads macOS accessibility tree via persistent `ax_server` (compiled Swift sidecar). Actions: `read_tree`, `click`, `press`, `set_value`, `get_value`, `find`, `scroll`, `annotate`. Semantic depth traversal (layout containers cost 0), click auto-fallback (AXPress → synthetic coordinate click). Works with Finder, Safari, Chrome, TextEdit, Calendar, System Settings, etc. |
| `wait_for` | Yes | Wait for UI conditions: `elementExists`, `elementGone`, `titleContains`, `urlContains`, `titleChanged`, `urlChanged`. Use instead of sleep after navigation or app launch. |
| `clipboard` | Yes | Read/write system clipboard (pbcopy/pbpaste) |
| `notify` | Yes | macOS desktop notifications via osascript |
| `applescript` | Yes | Execute arbitrary AppleScript. Use for operations with no AX equivalent (e.g., "tell Finder to empty trash") |
| `screenshot` | Yes | Screen capture (fullscreen/window/region). Visual fallback when accessibility tree is insufficient |
| `computer` | Yes | Mouse/keyboard via CGEvent (CJK/emoji safe). Click, type, hotkey, move, screenshot. Fallback when accessibility refs don't work or for drag operations. No Python dependency. |
| `browser` | Yes | Browser automation via Playwright MCP (preferred), pinchtab, or chromedp fallback. When Playwright MCP is configured, the legacy browser tool is auto-disabled. Isolated profile for web scraping; pinchtab connects to user's real browser for authenticated sessions. |
| `ghostty` | Yes | Ghostty terminal control: open tabs, splits, send input. Requires [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) >= 1.3.0. |

### Scheduling

| Tool | Approval | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `schedule_create` | Yes | Create a launchd-backed scheduled task |
| `schedule_list` | No | List all scheduled tasks with sync status |
| `schedule_update` | Yes | Update cron, prompt, or enabled state |
| `schedule_remove` | Yes | Remove a scheduled task and unload plist |

### Session Search

| Tool | Approval | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `session_search` | No | FTS5 keyword search across past session messages |

### Memory, Skills & Cloud

| Tool | Approval | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `memory_append` | No | Append entries to agent MEMORY.md (flock-protected) |
| `use_skill` | No | Activate a skill by name — returns full SKILL.md body. Skill discovery auto-suggests relevant skills each turn via `model_tier: small` prefetch. |
| `cloud_delegate` | Yes | Delegate tasks to Shannon Cloud for remote research/swarm execution |

### Tool Approval Flow

```
Tool call from LLM
  → Permission engine (hard-block → denied_commands → split compounds → allowed_commands → default safe)
  → RequiresApproval + SafeChecker
  → Pre-tool hook (can deny)
  → Execute tool
  → Post-tool hook
  → Audit log
```

- **Hard-blocked**: `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, `curl|sh`, etc. — always denied, cannot be overridden
- **CWD auto-approve**: Read-only tools (`file_read`, `glob`, `grep`, `directory_list`) auto-approve paths under the session working directory (request `cwd` → resumed session → agent config `cwd` → process CWD fallback)
- **Auto-approve**: Safe bash commands (`ls`, `git status`, `go test`, `make`, etc.), `process list/ports`, localhost HTTP
- **Prompt**: Destructive tools show `[y/n]` in TUI or one-shot mode
- **Denied-call blocking**: If you deny a tool call, the same tool+args won't be re-prompted for the rest of the turn
- **`-y` flag**: Auto-approves everything in one-shot mode
- **No handler**: Denied by default (security fail-safe)

## Permission Engine

6-step command resolution:

1. **Hard-block** — built-in constants (rm -rf /, mkfs, dd, curl|sh, etc.), cannot be overridden
2. **Denied commands** — `permissions.denied_commands` in config
3. **Compound command split** — `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|` are split and checked per sub-command
4. **Allowed commands** — `permissions.allowed_commands` in config (glob patterns)
5. **Default safe commands** — built-in safe list (ls, git status, go test, make, etc.)
6. **User approval** — interactive prompt or `-y` flag

For compound commands, every sub-command must be explicitly allowed to auto-allow the whole command. If any sub-command is denied, the whole command is denied.

Additional checks:
- **File paths**: symlink protection (`filepath.EvalSymlinks`), sensitive file patterns (`.env`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa`), allowed_dirs
- **Network egress**: allowlist-based, localhost always allowed
- **Hooks**: PreToolUse can deny with exit code 2

## Audit Logging

All tool calls are logged to `~/.shannon/logs/audit.log`:

- JSON-lines format, append-only
- Each entry: timestamp, session ID, tool name, input/output summary, decision, approved, duration
- **Auto-redaction**: AWS keys, JWT, `sk-`/`key-` prefixes, Bearer tokens, PEM markers, env var assignments

## Hooks

Shell scripts triggered at lifecycle events:

| Hook | When | Can Deny |
|------|------|----------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before tool execution | Yes (exit 2) |
| `PostToolUse` | After tool execution | No |
| `SessionStart` | Session begins | No |
| `Stop` | Session ends | No |

Configure in `~/.shannon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  PostToolUse:
    - matcher: "file_edit|file_write"
      command: ".shannon/hooks/post-edit.sh"
```

Hook protocol:
- Receives JSON on stdin with tool name, arguments, result
- Exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = deny (PreToolUse only)
- 10s timeout, 10KB output limit
- Hook commands must use `./` prefix (relative) or absolute paths under `~/.shannon/` (bare command names and absolute paths outside `~/.shannon/` are rejected for security)

## MCP Server

Expose local tools to MCP clients via JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio:

```bash
shan mcp serve
```

The MCP server enforces the same permission engine, hooks, and audit logging as the interactive CLI. Tools requiring approval are denied in MCP mode (no interactive TTY).

Supported methods:
- `initialize` — handshake with protocol version
- `tools/list` — returns all tool schemas
- `tools/call` — execute a tool by name with arguments

Example:
```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | shan mcp serve
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"system_info","arguments":{}}}' | shan mcp serve
```

## MCP Client

Connect to external MCP servers to extend Shannon with third-party tools. Configure in `~/.shannon/config.yaml` under `mcp_servers:`.

Each server supports:
- `command` / `args` — stdio transport (default)
- `type: http` + `url` — HTTP transport
- `env` — environment variables passed to the server process
- `context` — guidance injected into the LLM system prompt (critical for correct tool usage)
- `disabled: true` — skip without removing config

### Filesystem

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  filesystem:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/you/Desktop", "/Users/you/Documents"]
    context: "Filesystem access to ~/Desktop and ~/Documents. Use read_file, write_file, list_directory, search_files."
```

```bash
shan "list files on my Desktop"
shan "search for .md files in my Documents"
shan "create a notes.txt file on my Desktop"
```

### SQLite

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  sqlite:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "mcp-server-sqlite-npx", "/path/to/database.db"]
    context: "Connected to SQLite database. Use read_query for SELECT, write_query for writes."
```

### HTTP Transport (Remote MCP Server)

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  my-remote-server:
    type: http
    url: "https://mcp.example.com/sse"
    context: "Remote MCP server providing custom tools."
```

### Multiple Servers

You can run multiple MCP servers simultaneously:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  filesystem:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/you/Desktop"]
    context: "Filesystem access to ~/Desktop."
  sqlite:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "mcp-server-sqlite-npx", "/path/to/database.db"]
    context: "SQLite database."
```

### MCP Client Notes

- **`context` is critical** — tells the LLM who's authenticated and what queries to use. Without it, the LLM guesses wrong.
- **All MCP tools require approval**. Use `shan -y` for auto-approve in one-shot mode.
- **Local tools take priority** — if an MCP tool has the same name as a local tool, the local one wins.
- **Project-level overrides** — put server configs in `.shannon/config.yaml` (project) or `.shannon/config.local.yaml` (gitignored).
- **One-shot vs interactive** — each `shan "query"` starts fresh MCP connections. In interactive TUI mode (`shan`), connections persist for the session.
- Find more servers at [MCP Server Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/) and [Awesome MCP Servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers).

## Configuration

### Multi-level Config

Config files are merged in order (later overrides earlier):

1. `~/.shannon/config.yaml` — global
2. `.shannon/config.yaml` — project
3. `.shannon/config.local.yaml` — local override (gitignored)

Merge behavior: scalars override, lists merge + dedup, structs field-level merge.

All are loaded into the system prompt (token-budgeted, deduplicated). Markdown links to `.md` files in the same directory are auto-expanded inline.

### Persistent Memory

- `~/.shannon/memory/MEMORY.md` — first 200 lines loaded on startup
- The agent can write to this file to remember information across sessions

### Custom Slash Commands

Create `.shannon/commands/<name>.md` or `~/.shannon/commands/<name>.md`:

```markdown
Review the following code for bugs and security issues.
Focus on: $ARGUMENTS
```

This creates a `/name` command in the TUI. `$ARGUMENTS` is replaced with whatever follows the command.

## Sessions

Conversations are persisted as JSON files in `~/.shannon/sessions/` (or `~/.shannon/agents/<name>/sessions/` for named agents).

- Each session is a `<id>.json` file containing messages, metadata, and remote task IDs
- Saved after each agent turn and on exit
- Titles generated from the first user message (truncated to 50 chars)
- **Search index**: a `sessions.db` (SQLite FTS5) is auto-created alongside JSON files for fast keyword search. Safe to delete — rebuilds automatically on next launch

```
/sessions                              # interactive picker
/session resume 1                      # by number
/session resume 2026-02-23-a1b2c3      # by full ID
/session new                           # start fresh
```

## Named Agents

Create independent agents with their own instructions, memory, tools, MCP servers, and model settings:

```
~/.shannon/agents/
  ops-bot/
    AGENT.md          # agent instructions (replaces default system prompt)
    MEMORY.md         # agent-specific memory (persists across sessions)
    config.yaml       # optional: tool filtering, MCP scoping, model overrides
    commands/          # optional: agent-scoped slash commands (*.md)
    _attached.yaml     # optional: attached installed skill names
```

### Creating an Agent

Minimal agent — just `AGENT.md`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.shannon/agents/ops-bot
cat > ~/.shannon/agents/ops-bot/AGENT.md << 'EOF'
You are ops-bot, a production operations assistant.
- Monitor health metrics and error rates
- Summarize incidents concisely
- Always recommend next steps
EOF
```

Agents without `config.yaml` inherit all tools, global MCP servers, and default model settings.

### Agent Config

Create `config.yaml` to scope an agent's capabilities:

```yaml
# Default project directory for this agent.
# Must be an absolute path. Drives: prompt context, instructions,
# file tools, bash, auto-approval scope, read-before-edit tracking.
# Request-level cwd and resumed sessions can override this default.
cwd: /Users/you/Code/myproject

# Tool allow list — agent can ONLY use these tools
tools:
  allow:
    - file_read
    - grep
    - glob
    - bash
    - think
    - directory_list

# Per-agent MCP servers
# _inherit: false → only these servers (ignore global config)
# _inherit: true  → merge on top of global servers
mcp_servers:
  _inherit: false
  filesystem:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/you/Desktop"]

# Model and behavior overrides
agent:
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  max_iterations: 10
  temperature: 0.2
  max_tokens: 16000
  context_window: 64000

# File system watcher — trigger agent on file changes
watch:
  - path: ~/Code/myproject
    glob: "*.go"
  - path: ~/Downloads
    glob: "*.csv"

# Heartbeat — periodic "anything need attention?" checks
heartbeat:
  every: 30m                    # Go duration (required)
  active_hours: "09:00-22:00"   # optional time window (supports overnight e.g. "22:00-02:00")
  model: small                  # optional cheaper model for heartbeat runs
  isolated_session: true        # default true — fresh session per heartbeat
```

**Tool filtering options:**

```yaml
# Allow list — only these tools available
tools:
  allow: [file_read, grep, glob, bash]

# OR deny list — all tools EXCEPT these
tools:
  deny: [computer, browser, screenshot, applescript]

# Omit tools section entirely → all tools available
```

The filter applies to all tool sources (local, MCP, gateway). If both `allow` and `deny` are set, `allow` takes precedence.

### Project Context and `cwd`

ShanClaw uses a session-scoped working directory (`cwd`) to decide which project a run is operating in.

This affects:

- relative file paths
- project instructions
- bash execution
- safe path checks
- read-before-edit tracking
- project-local runtime config

The effective `cwd` is resolved in this order:

1. request `cwd`
2. stored session `cwd` for resumed sessions
3. agent config `cwd`
4. process working directory fallback

This means:

- a request can explicitly target a project
- resumed sessions return to the same project
- agents can define a default project
- older flows still keep working through fallback behavior

Project-local config is still loaded from the active project directory, but only for session-safe runtime fields such as:

- `model_tier`
- `agent.*`
- `tools.*`
- `permissions.*`

Process-global settings remain global and are not overridden by project-local config:

- `endpoint`
- `api_key`
- `mcp_servers`
- `daemon.*`
- `auto_update_check`

### Agent Commands

Create `.md` files in the `commands/` directory to add agent-scoped slash commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.shannon/agents/reviewer/commands

cat > ~/.shannon/agents/reviewer/commands/review.md << 'EOF'
Review the code in $ARGUMENTS for:
- Correctness and logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
Focus on bugs that matter, skip nitpicks.
EOF
```

Use in the TUI: `/review src/auth/login.go`

`$ARGUMENTS` is replaced with everything after the command name. Agent commands cannot overwrite built-in commands (`/help`, `/quit`, etc.).

### Agent Skills

Skills use the [Anthropic SKILL.md spec](https://agentskills.io/specification). Install skills globally, then attach them to an agent by name:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.shannon/skills/summarize

cat > ~/.shannon/skills/summarize/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: summarize
description: Summarize codebase architecture
---

Provide a concise summary of the architecture and key decisions.
Focus on: entry points, data flow, error handling patterns.
EOF

cat > ~/.shannon/agents/reviewer/_attached.yaml << 'EOF'
- summarize
EOF
```

Attached skill names are resolved from installed skills in `~/.shannon/skills/`. Bundled skills must be installed before they can be attached to an agent.

Skills are listed in the system prompt (name + description only). The LLM activates a skill by calling the `use_skill` tool, which returns the full SKILL.md body — progressive disclosure that keeps prompt size small.

Attached agent skills also appear as `/summarize` slash commands in the TUI.

### Using Agents

```bash
# One-shot mode
shan --agent ops-bot "check error rate in prod"

# Interactive TUI (with agent commands and attached skills as /slash commands)
shan --agent ops-bot

# In daemon mode, @mention routes to agents:
# "@ops-bot check prod" → ops-bot agent
# "@reviewer look at PR" → reviewer agent
# "check prod" → default Shannon agent
```

### Agent Name Rules

Names must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$` (lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores).

### Agent-Scoped Sessions

Each agent gets its own session directory at `~/.shannon/agents/<name>/sessions/`, keeping conversation histories separate.

## Daemon Mode

The daemon serves two roles: it connects to Shannon Cloud via WebSocket to receive channel messages (Slack, LINE, etc.), and it exposes a local HTTP API on port 7533 for native apps and scripts.

```bash
shan daemon start           # foreground (logs to stdout)
shan daemon start -d        # background via launchd (macOS, survives reboots)
shan daemon stop            # stop daemon + remove launchd service if installed
shan daemon status          # show connection status + launchd state
```

### Architecture

```
Slack/LINE ──webhook──▶ Shannon Cloud ──WebSocket──▶ shan daemon (macOS)
                                                      ├─ Agent loop + local tools
                                                      └─ HTTP :7533 (local API)
                                                           ▲
                                              curl / native apps / scripts
```

### Channel Messaging (via Shannon Cloud)

- **Envelope protocol** — typed messages with claim/ack handshake (broadcast + first-to-claim)
- **Progress heartbeats** — 15s interval extends claim TTL during long agent runs
- **Channel routing** — agent name set per channel in cloud config, fallback to `@mention` parsing
- **Session continuity** — conversation history maintained per agent across messages
- **Up to 5 concurrent agents** — bounded worker pool prevents resource exhaustion
- **Auto-reconnect** with exponential backoff on connection loss
- **Graceful disconnect** — sends disconnect message on shutdown
- **Schedule mutation tools** (`schedule_create/update/remove`) are denied by default in daemon mode
- **Interactive approval** — tools requiring approval send requests to the client app (via WS relay through Shannon Cloud); supports "always allow" persistence for bash commands
- **HITL message injection** — send follow-up messages to a running agent via `POST /message`; messages are injected mid-turn and incorporated into the conversation
- **File attachments** — Slack/Feishu messages with file attachments are automatically downloaded to `~/.shannon/tmp/attachments/` and converted to `file_ref` content blocks. Supports up to 10 files per message (100 MB each). SSRF-protected with scheme/IP validation. Cleaned up on session close.

### Local HTTP API (port 7533)

The daemon exposes a localhost-only HTTP server for native app integration and scripting.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | GET | Liveness check → `{"status":"ok","version":"..."}` |
| `/status` | GET | Connection state, active agent, uptime, version |
| `/agents` | GET | List named agents from `~/.shannon/agents/` |
| `/sessions` | GET | List sessions, optional `?agent=` filter |
| `/sessions/{id}` | GET | Get full session with messages, `?agent=<name>` |
| `/sessions/{id}/edit` | POST | Truncate history at index, re-run with new content (edit & retry) |
| `/sessions/search` | GET | Search session history, `?q=<query>&agent=<name>` |
| `/message` | POST | Send a message to an agent, get reply (supports HITL injection) |
| `/config/reload` | POST | Reload config, restart watchers and heartbeat managers |
| `/events` | GET | SSE stream of daemon events (`agent_reply`, `heartbeat_alert`, etc.) |
| `/shutdown` | POST | Graceful daemon shutdown (used by `shan daemon stop`) |

**Send a message:**

```bash
# Synchronous (blocks until agent completes)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7533/message \
  -d '{"text":"what is 2+2?"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# With a named agent and session resumption
curl -X POST http://localhost:7533/message \
  -d '{"text":"check disk usage","agent":"ops-bot","session_id":"2026-03-08-abc123"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# SSE streaming (tool progress + text deltas)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7533/message \
  -d '{"text":"analyze this codebase"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream"
```

**Response (synchronous):**

```json
{
  "reply": "2+2 equals 4.",
  "session_id": "2026-03-08-a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "agent": "",
  "usage": {"input_tokens": 150, "output_tokens": 20, "total_tokens": 170, "cost_usd": 0.002}
}
```

**Bridging a messaging platform (Discord, Matrix, custom webhook, etc.) to the daemon?** See the [Channel Integration Guide](examples/channel-integration-guide.md) for the full `POST /message` + SSE + interactive approval workflow, plus a community reference Discord bot. Official Slack/LINE/Feishu/Lark integrations go through Shannon Cloud for multi-tenant OAuth and audit — the local HTTP path here is for personal/dev deployments.

## Scheduled Tasks

Run agents on a cron schedule using macOS launchd. Schedules persist across reboots.

### CLI Management

```bash
shan schedule create --agent ops-bot --cron "0 9 * * *" --prompt "check production health"
shan schedule create --cron "*/30 * * * *" --prompt "check disk usage"
shan schedule list
shan schedule update <id> --cron "0 8 * * 1-5" --prompt "weekday morning check"
shan schedule enable <id>
shan schedule disable <id>
shan schedule remove <id>
shan schedule sync            # re-sync failed/pending launchd plists
```

### Agent-Accessible Tools

Agents can also manage schedules via tools:

```bash
shan "schedule a daily health check at 9am using ops-bot"
# Agent calls schedule_create tool → generates launchd plist
shan "what schedules are running?"
# Agent calls schedule_list tool
shan "cancel the morning health check"
# Agent calls schedule_remove tool
```

| Tool | Approval | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `schedule_create` | Yes | Create a new scheduled task |
| `schedule_list` | No | List all scheduled tasks |
| `schedule_update` | Yes | Update cron, prompt, or enabled state |
| `schedule_remove` | Yes | Remove a scheduled task |

### Cron Syntax

Full 5-field cron expressions supported (via [gronx](https://github.com/adhocore/gronx)):

```
┌───── minute (0-59)
│ ┌───── hour (0-23)
│ │ ┌───── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ ┌───── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───── day of week (0-6, Sun=0)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

Supports ranges (`1-5`), steps (`*/5`), lists (`1,3,5`), and combinations.

### How It Works

- **Source of truth:** `~/.shannon/schedules.json` (JSON index with sync status)
- **Execution backend:** `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.shannon.schedule.<id>.plist`
- Each schedule runs `shan -y --agent <name> "<prompt>"` in one-shot mode
- Logs written to `~/.shannon/logs/schedule-<id>.log`
- Atomic file writes (temp + rename) and file locking prevent corruption
- `SyncStatus` tracks whether launchd is in sync: `ok`, `pending`, or `failed`
- `shan schedule sync` retries any failed plist operations

## File System Watcher

Agents can react to file changes in real-time. Configure watched paths in the agent's `config.yaml`:

```yaml
watch:
  - path: ~/Code/myproject
    glob: "*.go"              # optional — omit to watch all files
  - path: ~/Downloads
    glob: "*.csv"
```

When files matching the glob are created, modified, deleted, or renamed, the agent receives a prompt like:

```
File changes detected:
- modified: internal/agent/loop.go
- created: internal/agent/loop_test.go
```

- **Debounce**: Changes are batched over a 2-second window to avoid flooding from rapid saves
- **Recursive**: Existing subdirectories are watched at startup; new subdirectories are auto-added
- **Routing**: Events route to the agent's session (`agent:<name>` key), sharing context with other messages
- **Fan-out**: If multiple agents watch overlapping directories, each gets its own event batch
- **Reload**: `POST /config/reload` rebuilds all watchers from fresh agent configs

## Heartbeat Mode

Agents can run periodic health checks using a configurable heartbeat. Define the checklist in `HEARTBEAT.md`:

```bash
cat > ~/.shannon/agents/ops-bot/HEARTBEAT.md << 'EOF'
- Check if any git repos in ~/Code have uncommitted changes
- Check if disk usage > 90%
- Check if any background processes are stuck
EOF
```

Configure the interval in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
heartbeat:
  every: 30m                    # required — Go duration
  active_hours: "09:00-22:00"   # optional (supports overnight e.g. "22:00-02:00")
  model: small                  # optional — cheaper model for cost control
  isolated_session: true        # default true — fresh session per heartbeat
```

### Silent-Ack Protocol

If everything is fine, the agent replies `HEARTBEAT_OK` — this is silently dropped (no notification, no session persistence). If something needs attention, the reply is emitted as a `heartbeat_alert` event on the EventBus and logged.

### Cost Controls

- **Isolated sessions** (default): No conversation history carried between heartbeats
- **Model override**: Use a cheaper model tier for routine checks
- **Empty checklist**: If `HEARTBEAT.md` is missing or empty, the heartbeat is skipped entirely (no tokens spent)
- **Overlap prevention**: If a previous heartbeat is still running, the next tick is skipped

## SSE Event Handling

Remote workflows (`/research`, `/swarm`) stream events via SSE:

| Event | Display |
|-------|---------|
| `WORKFLOW_STARTED` | `> Starting workflow...` |
| `PROGRESS`, `STATUS_UPDATE` | `> Processing...` |
| `AGENT_STARTED` | `> Agent working...` |
| `TOOL_INVOKED`, `TOOL_STARTED` | `? Calling tool...` |
| `thread.message.delta` | Streaming text (incremental) |
| `thread.message.completed` | Final response |
| `WORKFLOW_FAILED`, `error` | `! Error: ...` |

## UI Behavior

- **Inline terminal rendering** (no alt screen) — allows normal mouse text selection
- **Scrollable viewport** with Up/Down/PgUp/PgDn
- **Slash command menu**: appears on `/`, filters as you type, Tab/Enter to select
- **Session picker**: navigable list with Up/Down
- **Token usage**: `[tokens: N | cost: $X.XXXX]` after each response

## Keyboard

| Key | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Up/Down | Output | Scroll viewport |
| Up/Down | Command menu | Navigate items |
| Tab/Enter | Command menu | Insert selected command |
| Enter | Input | Submit message |
| Escape | Menu/picker | Close |
| y/n | Approval prompt | Approve/deny tool call |
| Ctrl+C | Any | Save session and exit |

## Building & Testing

```bash
go build -o shan .           # build
go test ./...                # run all tests
go vet ./...                 # lint
```

## Known Limitations

- **Vision**: Screenshots are captured, resized (1200px max), and sent as base64 image content blocks to the LLM. The computer tool uses Anthropic's native `computer_20251124` schema with coordinate scaling for retina displays. Vision models may blend what they see with training knowledge — verify critical details.
- **Streaming**: One-shot mode does not stream responses; it waits for the full LLM response before displaying.
- **Windows/Linux**: Local tools (clipboard, notifications, AppleScript, screenshot, computer) and scheduled tasks (launchd) are macOS-only.
- **Daemon background mode**: `shan daemon start -d` uses launchd (macOS only).
- **Scheduled tasks**: launchd-only (macOS). Complex cron expressions (ranges, steps) fall back to `StartInterval` instead of `StartCalendarInterval`.
