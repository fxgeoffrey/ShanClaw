All notable changes to ShanClaw are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Delta injection** — `DeltaProvider` interface polled at loop iteration boundary. Ships `TemporalDelta` (date rollover detection). Delta messages visible to model mid-run but excluded from session persistence.
- **Contrast examples** — 5 GOOD/BAD behavioral pairs targeting cowork failure modes (over-engineering, coding-default bias, premature completion, narrating instead of acting, wrong cloud/local boundary). Cloud/local pair conditional on `cloud_delegate` availability.
- **Bundled specialist agents** — `@explorer` (read-only orientation) and `@reviewer` (critical evaluation) embedded via `embed.FS`, synced to `_builtin/` on startup. Two-step `LoadAgent` resolution (user > builtin). CRUD protection with full-snapshot materialization before writes.
- **Session-scoped CWD** — each run carries its own project directory, resolving the daemon CWD gap. Priority cascade: request `cwd` → resumed session → agent config `cwd` → process fallback.
- **Structured inject payload** — follow-up injection uses `InjectedMessage` instead of raw text. Active-run CWD is immutable (different-CWD follow-ups return `cwd_conflict` 409).
- **Project config overlay** — project-local config loaded at runtime from session CWD, scoped to session-safe fields (`model_tier`, `agent.*`, `tools.*`, `permissions.*`). Process-global settings (`endpoint`, `api_key`, `mcp_servers`, `daemon.*`) no longer overridden.

### Fixed
- `listAgentNames` now returns `([]string, error)` — propagates I/O errors, only swallows `os.IsNotExist`
- `EnsureBuiltins` uses `os.CreateTemp` for race-safe temp files
- `GET /agents/{name}` matches `ListAgents` semantics: `Builtin=true` only when no user override exists
- Path traversal canonicalization and symlink escape prevention in `IsUnderSessionCWD`
- Cold-start resume treats empty resumed session as fresh
- Heartbeat CWD carryover and one-shot validation
- `cloud_delegate` deep-copied per-run to prevent concurrent daemon route races

## v0.0.91

### Added
- **Context quality Phase 1–3** — compaction floor, session-scoped tool warming, reactive compaction recovery

### Fixed
- Agent skill CRUD aligned with manifest-based attachment model
- Spill cleanup lifetime scoped to session, spurious `OnToolCall` suppressed
- TUI rendering: header duplication, resize, response positioning

## v0.0.9

### Added
- **Prompt cache stability** — `PromptParts` (static/stable/volatile) split, `ToolSourcer` sorted ordering, cache telemetry
- **Context management** — tiered compaction with head+tail truncation, reactive compaction on overflow, two-phase compression with analysis scratchpad, micro-compact LLM summary, memory staleness annotation
- **Tool safety** — partitioned batch execution (read-only parallel, writes serialized), disk spill for large results (>50K), deferred tool loading (`tool_search` meta-tool)
- **Output format profiles** — channel-aware formatting (`markdown` for TUI/web, `plain` for Slack/LINE/Telegram/webhook)
- **Self-awareness and system reminders** — reinforcement hints in long sessions
- `OnToolCall` fires at actual execution start (post-semaphore)
- `ax_server` bundled mode with Unix socket transport
- `cloud_delegate` terminal param for loop continuation control

### Fixed
- Deferred `tool_search` continuation (model proceeds after schema load)
- Cache ratio formula corrected for Anthropic token semantics
- Volatile context stripped from persisted session history
- API key whitespace trimmed in all config load/save paths
- Per-message timestamps in session persistence

## v0.0.8

### Added
- **Manifest-based skill attachment** for agents (name-only attachment, replace semantics)
- Bundled skills moved to installable, hidden from default skills list

### Fixed
- Playwright CDP lifecycle: lazy-launch, race conditions, Chrome cleanup
- CDP Chrome launched offscreen to prevent window flash
- Orphaned CDP Chrome cleanup after daemon hard kill
- Bundled skills removed from runtime loading (global-only resolution)
